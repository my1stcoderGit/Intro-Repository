     We can add files and changes by using git add [command filename...].
     Also if there are large amount of files then we just just git add . command only and all the files will be added to the repository and become staged.
     WE can use clear command to clear all the commands in the terminal.
     WE can use ls command to see all the files and directories in the current directory.
     WE can use cd [name of internal directory...] command to change the directory to the internal directory.
     WE can use cd .. command to go back to the previous directory.
