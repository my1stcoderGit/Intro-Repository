     1. We can use git --help to see all the git commands and their usage.
     1.WE can use git clone [repository URL...] to clone a remote repository to the local machine.
     2. We can add files and changes by using git add [commandfilename...].
     3. Also if there are large amount of files then we just just git add . command only and all the files will be added to the repository and become staged.
     4. WE can use clear command to clear all the commands in the terminal.
     5. WE can use ls command to see all the files and directories in the current directory.
     6. WE can use cd [nameofTargetdirectory...] command to change the directory to the Target directory.
     7. WE can use cd .. command to go back to the previous directory.
     8. WE can use mkdir [nameofdirectory...] command to create a new directory.
     9. We can use touch [nameoffile...] command to create a new file.
     10. WE can use git config --global user.name "your name" to set the user name for git commits.
     11. WE can use git config --global user.email "your email" to set the user email for git commits.
     12. WE can use git config --global --list to see the list of all the global configurations.
     13. WE use git branch [branchname...] to create a new branch.
     14. WE use git checkout [Targetbranchname...] to switch to the specified branch.
     15. WE use git checkout -b [newbranchname...] to create and switch to a new branch in a single command.
     16. WE use git -d [branchname...] to delete the specified branch.Note we cannot delete the branch we are currently on.
     17. WE use git merge [branchname...] to merge the specified branch into the current branch.
     18. There are two ways to merge and compare branches one is by using git commands and other is by using Pull Requests(PR) on GitHub.
     19. WE use git diff [SpecificBranchname...] to see the differences between the current branch and the specific branch.
     20. We use git merge [SpecificBranchname...] to merge the specific branch into the current branch.
     21. For merging branches on Github we need to send a pull request(PR) to the repository owner and after review the changes will be merged.
     22. WE use git pull origin [branchname...] to pull the latest changes from the remote repository to the local repository.
     23. WE use git push origin [branchname...] to push the local changes to the remote repository.
     24. Also there are two ways to check commit history one is by using git log command and other is by using GitHub website.
     25. Also we can copy the commit hash from git log and also from GitHub website.
     26. WE can use git reset [commit hash...] to reset the current branch to the specified commit hash.Also we can use git reset --hard [commit hash...] to reset the git to a specific commit also from the VS code.
     27. WE can use git clone [repository URL...] to clone a remote repository to the local machine.
     28. WE use git reset [FileNAme...] to unstage a file.
     29. WE use git reset to unstage all the files.
     30. WE use git reset HEAD~1 to undo the last commit.
     31. We initialize our empty local git using **git int** command.
     32. We can Clone our remote repository in our Empty local repository using git **clone <repository-url>** command.
     33. We can pull changes from our Remote repository to our local repository using git pull origin <branchname> command.
     34. git fetch origin This command downloads all new data from the remote but doesn’t change your working files.
     35. There is no direct command to sync changes so we first push changes and then pull changes or vice versa.
     36. Origin is just a name that we give to that paricular repository. We can also write any name instead of that.
     37. WE can use git push origin main --force command to forcely push changes from local to remote if remote repo have some content which your local dont have. 
     38. WE can use git remote add origin <Repo URL> command to just link a local repo to the remote repo without cloning. 
     39. WE can use git remote -v command to verify if our both local and remote are linked or not.

        1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
        2. Create a local repository on your machine and intialize it by using git init command.
        2. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone [repository URL].
        3. Navigate to the repository directory using cd [repository name].
        4. Make changes to your files and use git add [file name] or git add . to stage the changes.
        5. Commit the changes with a descriptive message using git commit -m "your message".
